These will also support domestic manufacturing and \nvalue addition, promote exports, facilitate trade and provide relief to common \npeople.  \nRationalisation of Customs Tariff Structure for Industrial Goods \n116. \nAs a part of comprehensive review of Customs rate structure \nannounced in July 2024 Budget, I propose to: \n(i) \nremove seven tariff rates. This is over and above the seven tariff \nrates removed in 2023-24 budget. After this, there will be only eight \nremaining tariff rates including \u2018zero\u2019 rate.  \n(ii) \napply appropriate cess to broadly maintain effective duty incidence \nexcept on a few items, where such incidence will reduce marginally.  \n(iii) \nlevy not more than one cess or surcharge. Therefore, I propose to \nexempt Social Welfare Surcharge on 82 tariff lines that are subject \nto a cess. \n117. \nI shall now take up sector specific proposals. \nRelief on import of Drugs/Medicines  \n118. \n To provide relief to patients, particularly those suffering from cancer, \nrare diseases and other severe chronic diseases, I propose to add 36 lifesaving \ndrugs and medicines to the list of medicines fully exempted from Basic Customs \nDuty (BCD).  I also propose to add 6 lifesaving medicines to the list attracting \nconcessional customs duty of 5%. Full exemption and concessional duty will \nalso respectively apply on the bulk drugs for manufacture of the above.  \n119. \nSpecified drugs and medicines under Patient Assistance Programmes \nrun by pharmaceutical companies are fully exempt from BCD, provided the \nmedicines are supplied free of cost to patients. I propose to add 37 more \nmedicines along with 13 new patient assistance programmes."

Now, \nI propose to fully exempt cobalt powder and waste, the scrap of lithium-ion \nbattery, Lead, Zinc and 12 more critical minerals. This will help secure their \navailability for manufacturing in India and promote more jobs for our youth.  \nTextiles \n121. \n To promote domestic production of technical textile products such as \nagro-textiles, medical textiles and geo textiles at competitive prices, I propose \nto add two more types of shuttle-less looms to the list of fully exempted textile \nmachinery.  I also propose to revise the BCD rate on knitted fabrics covered by \nnine tariff lines from \u201c10% or 20%\u201d to \u201c20% or ` 115 per kg, whichever is \nhigher\u201d. \nElectronic Goods \n122. \nIn line with our \u2018Make in India\u2019 policy, and to rectify inverted duty \nstructure, I propose to increase the BCD on Interactive Flat Panel Display (IFPD) \nfrom 10% to 20% and reduce the BCD to 5% on Open Cell and other \ncomponents.  \n123. \nIn 2023 -24 Budget, for the manufacture of Open Cells of LCD/LED TVs, \nI had reduced the BCD on parts of Open Cells from 5% to 2.5% . To further boost \nthe manufacture of such Open Cells, the BCD on these parts will now stand \nexempted. \nLithium Ion Battery \n124. \nTo the list of exempted capital goods, I propose to add 35 additional \ncapital goods for EV battery manufacturing, and 28 additional capital goods for \nmobile phone battery manufacturing. This will boost domestic manufacture of \nlithium-ion battery, both for mobile phones and electric vehicles. \nShipping Sector \n125. \n Considering that shipbuilding has a long gestation period, I propose to \ncontinue the exemption of BCD on raw materials, components, consumables \nor parts for the manufacture of ships for another ten years.

The Thirukkural captures this in Verse 542, \nwhich reads: \n\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0ba9 \u0bbe\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbf \u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bb4\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b89\u0bb2\u0b95\u0b95\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0bae\u0bcd \u0bae \u0bcd \u0bb5 \u0bcd \n\u0ba9\u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0ba9 \u0bbe\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbf \u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bb4\u0bc1\u0b99\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bc1\u0b9f\u0bbf. \nvaanokki vaalum ulakellaam mannavan \nkoalnokki vaalung kuti \nMeaning:  \nJust as living beings live expecting rains,  \nCitizens live expecting good governance."

The \nfollowing measures will detail just how our Government under the guidance of \nPM Modi has taken steps to understand and address the needs voiced by our \ncitizens. My tax proposals are guided by this spirit.  \n136. \nThe objectives of my proposals are as follows: \n(i) \nPersonal Income Tax reforms with special focus on middle class  \n(ii) \nRationalization of TDS/TCS for easing difficulties \n(iii) \nEncouraging voluntary compliance \n(iv) \nReducing compliance burden \n(v) \nEase of doing business \n(vi) \nEmployment and investment \nI will come to my proposal on personal income tax towards the end. \nTDS/TCS rationalization for easing difficulties \n137. \nI propose to rationalize Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) by reducing the \nnumber of rates and thresholds above which TDS is deducted. Further, \nthreshold amounts for tax deduction will be increased for better clarity and \nuniformity. The limit for tax deduction on interest for senior citizens is being \ndoubled from the present ` 50,000 to ` 1 lakh. Similarly, the annual limit of ` \n2.40 lakh for TDS on rent is being increased to ` 6 lakh. This will reduce the \nnumber of transactions liable to TDS, thus benefitting small tax payers \nreceiving small payments. \n138. \nThe threshold to collect tax at source (TCS) on remittances under RBI\u2019s \nLiberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) is proposed to be increased from ` 7 lakh \nto ` 10 lakh. I also propose to remove TCS on remittances for education \npurposes, where such remittance is out of a loan taken from a specified \nfinancial institution. \n139. \nBoth TDS and TCS are being applied on any transaction relating to sale \nof goods. To prevent such compliance difficulties, I propose to omit the TCS. I \nalso propose that the provisions of the higher TDS deduction will now apply \nonly in non-PAN cases."

I propose to provide the same relaxation to TCS \nprovisions as well.  \nEncouraging Voluntary Compliance \n141. \nThe Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi believes \nin \u201cSabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas and Sabka Prayas\u201d. In line with \nthis, we brought in updated return facility in 2022 for voluntary compliance by \ntaxpayers who had omitted to report their correct income. Our trust in \ntaxpayers was proved right. Nearly 90 lakh taxpayers voluntarily updated their \nincomes by paying additional tax. Taking this trust further, I now propose to \nextend the time-limit to file updated returns for any assessment year, from the \ncurrent limit of two years, to four years.  \nReducing Compliance Burden \n142. \nI propose to reduce the compliance burden for small charitable \ntrusts/institutions by increasing their period of registration from 5 years to 10 \nyears. It is also proposed that disproportionate consequences do not arise for \nminor defaults, such as incomplete applications filed by charitable entities. \n143. \nPresently tax-payers can claim the annual value of self-occupied \nproperties as nil only on the fulfilment of certain conditions. Considering the \ndifficulties faced by taxpayers, it is proposed to allow the benefit of two such \nself-occupied properties without any condition.  \nEase of Doing Business  \n144. \nTo streamline the process of transfer pricing and to provide an \nalternative to yearly examination, I propose to introduce a scheme for \ndetermining arm's length price of international transaction for a block period \nof three years. This will be in line with global best practices. \n145. \nWith a view to reduce litigation and provide certainty in international \ntaxation, the scope of safe harbour rules is being expanded.    \n146. \nA number of senior and very senior citizens have very old National \nSavings Scheme accounts. As interest is no longer payable on such accounts, I \npropose to exempt withdrawals made from NSS by individuals on or after the \n29th of August, 2024. I am also proposing to allow similar treatment to NPS \nVatsalya accounts as is available to normal NPS accounts, subject to overall \nlimits."

The scheme has received a great \nresponse, with nearly 33,000 tax payers having availed of this scheme to settle \ntheir disputes. \nEmployment and Investment \n149. \nI have a few proposals to promote investment and employment.  \nTax certainty for electronics manufacturing Schemes \n150. \nIt is proposed to provide a presumptive taxation regime for non-\nresidents who provide services to a resident company that is establishing or \noperating an electronics manufacturing facility. I further propose to introduce \na safe harbour for tax certainty for non-residents who store components for \nsupply to specified electronics manufacturing units. \nTonnage Tax Scheme for Inland Vessels \n151. \nPresently the tonnage tax scheme is available to only sea going ships. \nThe benefits of existing tonnage tax scheme are proposed to be extended to \ninland vessels registered under the Indian Vessels Act, 2021 to promote inland \nwater transport in the country. \nExtension for incorporation of Start-Ups \n152. \nWe continue to support the Indian start-up eco-system.

This Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi has \nalways believed in the admirable energy and ability of the middle class in \nnation building. In recognition of their contribution, we have periodically \nreduced their tax burden.

This limit will be ` 12.75 \nlakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of ` 75,000.  \n157. \nSlabs and rates are being changed across the board to benefit all tax-\npayers. The new structure will substantially reduce the taxes of the middle \nclass and leave more money in their hands, boosting household consumption, \nsavings and investment. \n158. \n In the new tax regime, I propose to revise tax rate structure as follows: \n0-4 lakh rupees \nNil \n4-8 lakh rupees \n5 per cent \n8-12 lakh rupees \n10 per cent \n12-16 lakh rupees \n15 per cent \n16-20 lakh rupees \n20 per cent \n20- 24 lakh rupees \n25 per cent \nAbove 24 lakh rupees \n30 per cent"

These include home office costs, vehicle costs, cell phone costs, self -employed retirement plan contributions, and self -employed health insurance premiums. 33 How Do High -Income Earners Reduce Taxes? High earners have many options to reduce their taxes. First, be sure to max out your retirement contributions. If you itemize deductions, you can donate appreciated long -term investments to charity. The advantages here are that you won't owe capital gains on the assets and you get a tax deduction for the full fair -market value of the donation, up to 30% of your AGI. Another strategy is to harvest your tax losses to offset some of the taxes you will owe if you realize significant capital ga ins. If you have $60,000 in gains, you could sell off investments that have a combined $60,000 in losses and thus cancel out the ga ins. Tax experts and financial advisors can provide additional strategies. 34 The Bottom Line It's important to pay all that is legally owed to tax authorities, but nobody has to pay extra. A few hours on the IRS websit e (IRS.gov ) and scouring reputable financial information sites may yield hundreds and maybe even thousands of dollars in tax savings.

Short -term capital gains are also classified on the basis of their holding period and the type of the asset.

You can calculate the indexed cost of acquisition using an indexed cost calculator Why are capital gains classified as short -term and long -term? The holding period of the asset defines its taxability. Whether you have to pay tax on a capital gain depends on how long you have held the asset. The tax rates on short -term and long -term capital gains also differ from each other. Therefore, capital asset s are classified as short -term and long -term. The sale of assets held for a period longer than 1 year and fixed assets held for a period longer than 3 years are chargeable to tax as long -term capital gains.

Long -term capital gains arise when the owner of an asset sells it at a profit after holding it for 1 year (in the case of shares a nd securities) and before 3 years (in the case of assets like land, buildings, etc.). The computation of long-term capital gains is performed as below - Long -term capital gain = Sale Price - (indexed cost of acquisition + indexed cost of improvement + transfer cost) \u25cf Indexed cost of acquisition = cost of acquisition x cost of inflation index of the year when the asset was transferred or acquired. \u25cf Indexed cost of improvement = cost of improvement x the cost inflation index of the year in which the asset was transferred or the cost inflation index of the year of improvement. The gain thus derived is taxed at the rates applicable based on the tax bracket and the type of asset. How to compute short -term capital gain? A short -term capital gain arises when a capital asset held for less than 1 year and 3 years is sold at a profit thereafter. Short -term capital gains on shares are computed as follows - Suppose you bought 100 shares of X Ltd. at Rs.100 each and sold at Rs. 120 after holding for 6 months.

The tax payable on Rs 51 lakh (without surcharge) is Rs 13,42,500. The surcharge amount will be Rs 1,34,250 . Here the surcharge amount (Rs 1,34,250) is higher than the additional income above Rs 50 lakh (Rs 1,00,000). This is where th e concept of marginal relief kicks in. To know the amount of marginal relief that is applicable, one needs to calculate income tax payable on Rs 50 lakh. This is be cause no surcharge will be applicable till the income exceeds Rs 50 lakh. The income tax payable will be Rs 13,12,500. Now add inco me above Rs 50 lakh (Rs 1 lakh) to the income tax payable amount. The tax payable amount under marginal relief will be Rs 14,12,500. To ascertain the actual income tax payable with surcharge, compare the normal tax liability (before surcharge and cess) and t ax liability after marginal tax relief (without cess). Normal tax liability is Rs 13,42,500 and tax liability after marginal tax re lief is Rs 14,12,500. The surcharge that will be applicable is Rs 70,000 (Rs 14,12,500 - Rs 13,42,500). The final tax payable amount will be Rs 13,42, 500 (Tax payable amount) + Rs 70,000 (Surcharge) + Rs 56,500 (Cess at 4% on Rs 14,12,500) = Rs 14,69,000.

Now, let\u2019s say that you\u2019re also eligible for one or more tax credits. They\u2019re worth $5,000. But that $5,000 doesn\u2019t reduce yo ur taxable income. It comes directly off the tax you owe the IRS on that $42,000. It\u2019s a dollar -for-dollar perk. A tax deduction worth a dollar is actually worth only 24 cents in a 24% tax bracket.

These are defined as long -term and short - term based on the duration for which you hold the units of the fund. The Income Tax Department allows investors to set off capital losses against capital gains to reduce tax liability. This mean s that in a financial year, if you have made short -term capital gains of Rs.50000 and short -term capital losses of Rs.10000, you ne ed to pay tax on the net gain of Rs 40000 (50k \u2013 40k) only. In Tax Loss Harvesting, you sell those stocks and equity fund units with little or no chance of recovering from their current levels at a loss. This helps in reducing the tax liability on capital gains. While most investors try harvesting their capital losses at the en d of the financial year, you can use it regularly to maintain your annual capital gains at a low level.

To understand how tax -loss harvesting works, let\u2019s use an example: Saurabh has an investment portfolio spread across stocks, equity funds, debt funds, etc. At the end of the financial year, Sa urabh\u2019s portfolio performed as follows: \u25cf Short -Term Capital Gains = Rs.80,000 \u25cf Long -Term Capital Gains = Rs.150,000 Hence, Saurabh\u2019s tax liability is as follows: STCG Tax = 80000 x 15% = Rs. 12000 LTCG Tax = (150000 \u2013 100000) x 10% = Rs. 5000 Total tax liability = 12000 + 5000 = Rs. 17,000 However, Saurabh notices that certain stocks in his portfolio have reached low levels with minimal chances of recovery.

Then, he uses the amount received to invest in more -promising stocks or equity funds. Hence, his tax liability becomes: STCG Tax = (80000 \u2013 30000) x 15% = Rs. 7500 LTCG Tax = Rs. 5000 Total tax liability = 7500 + 5000 = Rs. 12,500 Hence, he manages to save Rs.3500 in tax. Also, since he has invested the sales proceeds in another stock/mutual fund, there is a chance to recover the losses if the stock/fund performs well. This helps him maintain the asset allocation of the portfolio.

Are BTST Trades Speculative or Non -speculative? One of the fundamental ways of defining a speculative transaction in equity is determining if there is a delivery of shares a ssociated with the trade.

Indexation benefit calculation allows you to inflate your purchase price. This compensates you for inflation. So when you sel l your fund on a later date, indexation benefit will allow you to inflate your purchase price on that date to reflect the true valu e of your purchase. You may end up paying lower tax on debt mutual funds. Indexation in mutual funds is allowed only in the debt fund category. How Much Is The Tax Liability on Debt Mutual Fund Earnings? All forms of income through debt funds are subject to taxation as per the Income Tax Act of 1963. Tax liability on dividend returns of such funds is not levied on investors directly. Dividends received from mutual funds or after April 1, 2020 is taxable in the hands of the investors. The tax rate is depende nt on the income tax slab the investor falls in.There is also a TDS on dividend distribution by mutual funds from the same date. Th is is how debt fund taxation is done. Capital gains made through the purchase and sale of NAV units in the stock market are also taxable. They are known as capital gains. In debt mutual fund taxation, if the debt fund was sold before three years, it is known as short term capital gains. The tota l profit earned is taxable depending on the annual income of the investor. However if the debt fund is held for more than three years, the it is known as long term capital gains.

This 13 -14% jump fr om 67 to 75 is an embodiment of inflation and how it has reduced our purchasing power. Indexation benefit seeks to give you returns over and above this inflation.

Indexation Calculation for Debt Funds The total adjustment of capital gains depends on the cost inflation index (CII) declared by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) every year. The real value of profits can be determined by using the following indexation formula \u2013 Actual value after indexation = original amount * (CII of the current year/CII of the purchasing year.) Let us demonstrate this with an example. Mr. X had invested Rs. 1 Lakh in a debt mutual fund in 2014. Four years later, he decides to redeem his investment at Rs. 1.8 Lakh in 2018, thereby realizing a profit of Rs. 80,000. The nominal value of investment realized can be determined by the indexation formula \u2013 Actual purchase value after indexation = original amount x (CII of the current year/CII of the purchasing year) In 2014, the CII of India was 240. In 2018, the value increased to 280. Inflation -indexed worth = 1,00,000 * (280/240) = Rs. 1,16,666.67. Therefore, total gains realised = Redemption Value -Indexed Cost Rs (1,80,000 -1,16,666.667)= Rs 63,333.33 This value is subjected to a tax deduction of 20% of its value. Tax payable = 20/100 * 63,333 = Rs. 12,666.67 Total realisable profit= Redemption value -Tax payable Rs (80,000 -12,666.67)= Rs 67,333.33 Taxation without indexation benefit: The tax treatment of Rs 80,000, which is the capital gains in this example, will depend on the income tax bracket of the investor, if he/she decides to not opt for indexation benefit.

Final Words: Should You Go for Debt Fund Indexation Benefit? You should do the due diligence in doing the indexation benefit calculation and checking which system suits you best. You may never know what you are missing out on. As we mentioned above, it depends on various factors, one of them being your income level and tax bracket. Adjustments for indexation are not made in conventional savings schemes, such as fixed deposits. Thus, the tax payable on those earnings is considerably higher. You can choose between the two options available while determining your total tax liability. Using an indexation calculator, the total tax payable can be determined when the inflation rate is considered, while tax rates without adjustments can be calcula ted through standard calculators. Comparing the total tax liability and profits under both these situations, you can easily decide under which method you want to pay your taxes, thereby maximising the total returns earned.\n\nFor more details, refer to the official e-Filing guidelines."
